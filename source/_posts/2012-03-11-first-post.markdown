This is my first post using the Octopress/Jekyll. I had been using Wordpress before hoping that it would be an inpitus to learn some php. I just never had enough interest to put the time towards it. In fact this took a lot more work than a simple one-click install offered by my host.

I have been working to get off the dual boot and instead working with VirtualBox to have a Linux environment to work in. This was actually a benefit because I had to install some Ruby stuff in my virtual machine which I completely messed up. I think it was the combination of using apt and self installing some of the rvm libraries that completely broke my environment.

I ended up creating a new virtual machine and working from scratch. This time I installed rvm through the download which put my ruby stuff in my home directory instead of /usr/share or wherever. Now I am up and running even after a few restarts of the virtual machine. Why Jekyll though? I was thinking about renting a virtual server from Linode and rolling nginx. While that still seems like something cool to try I am going to put that on the back burner. I have so many other projects that I would like to do that rolling my own webserver would give me some hacker cred does not rank high on the list.

Some other projects I want to work on are a combination of hardware and software. On the hardware side I want to create a cool LED POV wheel kit for my awsome bike I got from State Bicyle. Software-wise I have been wanting to create a verilog generator from reading in validating some IPXACT using Xtext. I have been playing with that package since the summer. I have already created some Verilog editing functions I want to eventually extend that, put it on github, and show it off as part of my professional portfolio. Some of the other low-priority stuff is my chip-tune music, maybe a plugin for Jekyll and Steam, and finishing some of these Steam games that have piled up.
