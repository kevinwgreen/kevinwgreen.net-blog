I guess I broke my VritualBox Ubuntu VM.  I am not sure how that happened.  I decided to blow it away and start fresh with an upgraded version of VirtualBox.  I think I have everything set up again.  Though I have to say that setting up Ruby in Ubuntu is a major pain.  Also, I should be better about backing up the sit to Github since I didn't do any of that before the crash.
